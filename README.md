This repository contains demo test cases, sample automation scripts, and example bug reports created solely for showcasing my QA skills.
Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot upload any real project files, production code, or client-related documentation from my employers (FinTech/Banking domain).

All files here are:
-Self-created demonstrations
-Practice tasks
-Replicated examples based on public websites
-Generalized testing scenarios

These samples are meant to reflect my testing approach, documentation style, and technical capabilities without exposing any proprietary or confidential information.
